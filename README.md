# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was created to practice web development and store my notes in the cloud, rather than leave all my notes in a physical notebook, which I might lose. While making it I became more comfortable with HTML and the Git flow, and I also learned a lot about some JavaScript basics. Created for the 2022-2023 Coding Bootcamp with the University of Utah. Deployed at https://sumtwelve.github.io/bootcamp-study-guide/

## Table of Contents (Optional)

ToC not necessary but I thought it would be fun to try it out.

## Usage

Acess the website to view some notes I've taken on the course content.

To see what's happening under the hood, you'll need to open DevTools and view the Console. To do so, simply right-click anywhere in the page and select "Inspect". A little window will open on the bottom or side of the window, with the "Elements" tab selected. Simply click on "Console", which is right next to "Elements". There should be some text listing the course topics, as well as a randomly selected suggestion for which topic to study next!
